# open_cv_haar_study
Some studies done with haar cascades and building/training self model
for masked/no mask/partial mask detection.

Early models using a mask set from Kaggle via
https://www.kaggle.com/vijaykumar1799/face-mask-detection by vijay kumar

Ran 2-3 models with some changes but the detections were sub par as compared to
a model made on Google Teachable Machine model generation using my own faces.

Need to learn more about optimal additions/tweaking of layers for CNN
and the best parameters/hyperparameters for better recognition of
masked/no mask/partial faces
